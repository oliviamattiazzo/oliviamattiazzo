## Oh, hi! I'm Olivia 👋

I'm a passionate **software developer** and **M.Sc.'s student** with a strong focus on **problem-solving**. I consider myself **technology-agnostic**, always choosing the best tools for the job rather than sticking to any particular stack. As an **eternal learner**, I'm constantly exploring new technologies and methodologies to expand my skill set. Sharing knowledge is something I deeply value, which is why I regularly post insights and tutorials on my **blog**. I'm always open to collaboration and eager to contribute to the developer community!

In my free time, you can probably find me reading fiction books, playing D&D with my friends and planning my next trip!
